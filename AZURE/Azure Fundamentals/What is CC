Compute Power
Storage
Networking
Analytics of compute storage and network inorder to get visual telmetry and performance data.

## Goal
CC is to make running a business easier and more efficiant 

## Compute Power
A Virtual Machine is an emulation of computer.
Containers
Serverless computing

physical hardware -> Host operating system -> Hybervisor controller -> VM1
physical hardware -> Host operating system -> container engine -> container1
physical hardware -> Host operating system -> serverless runtime -> function

## Serverless computing
The core idea is that your application is broken into separate functions.
that run went triggered by some action. This ideal for automataed task.
such as you can build a serverless process that automatically sends an email.\
